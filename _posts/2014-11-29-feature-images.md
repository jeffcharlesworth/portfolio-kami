So I was learning Ruby on Rails. I was doing alright, but I had no one to ask questions. I felt like I was missing the interconnectedness of everything I was learning. After a year of self teaching while I was working, having a teacher sounded really great. I wanted to speed things up and make sure that I learned everything that I didn't know I needed to know.

I found Bloc after learning that there were code schools. I took my usual heavy handed approach to sorting through all my options. For anyone reading this considering a code school, there are tons of options out there. I chose Bloc because I could move at my own pace, the price was fair and they had a tuition guarantee, which made me feel like they stood behind their product. I didn't feel like I needed a classroom, as most of my future work as a developer would involve teaching myself. 

As I write this, I am just over a month into the program. They paired me up with an awesome mentor who is available whenever I need help or get stuck. I have two meetings a week with her and she answers all of my questions about the course, getting job, interviews, the tech scene, really whatever I feel like I need to know.

The best part for me is that I can move at the speed I want. I am about a third of the way through the course, which is faster than what the course calls for. So far I have got a pretty good grasp on front end development, I am writing applications in Javascript, jQuery, Angular. I just completed a chatroom with Angular and Firebase.

I feel great about the work that I have done so far. I am going to meetups and speaking with people in the industry. I am learning about different frameworks and libraries. I attended a meetup about artificial intelligence just last night that was excellent.

So far what I am getting from Bloc is a lot more than just learning to code. I am getting direction to find my first job and how to meet people already in the industry.

I am about to start the backend portion of the course, which is exciting. I finally get to dig into rails!
